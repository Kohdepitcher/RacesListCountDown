# Races Count Down

![Alt text](/Screenshots/App_Icon.png?raw=true "App Icon")

Built as tool to make my life a bit easier in a previous career. It became a little annoying trying to check when the next thoroughbred race was starting especially when working in an area with low cellular reception. I instead built an app that let me look at the upcoming meetings and then save one to then see a count down to each single race.

## Features
 - Meeting browser to see all upcoming meetings for a week
 - Pick which state to view meetings for with a picker
 - View a meeting in detail and save it locally for tracking
 - View a list of the saved races and a count down timer to when they start
